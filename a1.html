    <h1>Sports</h1>
    <h3>Football</h3>
    <p id="para1">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the
    word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly
    called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
    sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically
    American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby
    union football.</p>
    <p class="class1">The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football:
    carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the
    ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or passed by hand, and kicking codes such as association
    football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.</p>
    <p class="class2">There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of
    the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English
    public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football. The expansion and cultural power
    of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
    controlled empire.</p>
